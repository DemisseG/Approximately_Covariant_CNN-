### General Description
The code implements the main idea discussed in 
<ul> <li> Girum Demisse and Matt Feiszli. [Approximately Covariant Convolutional Networks](). Hal arXiv, 2021.</li> </ul>
  
### Code of Conduct
***If you use this software (Approximately_Covariant_CNN) in its entirety or partially, please consider citing the reference listed above.***

### Dataset
Inorder to conduct a direct test, you need to donwload a test dataset and dump it under "/data" folder; Rot-MNIST can be downloaded from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/lisa.iro.umontreal.ca/public_static_twiki/variations-on-the-mnist-digits)

### Requirments
The software is developed and tested using python3 with Pytorch 1.7.1 and Cuda 10.2.
You will need to have the latest versions of matplotlib, numpy, and pickle5.

### How To:
<ul>
